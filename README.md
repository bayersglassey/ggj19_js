We were a team of 5, making a game from scratch in 3 days.
I was the programmer, and chose Javascript as an excuse to learn the < canvas > element.

It uses classic JS prototype inheritance to implement a classic OOP
"everything inherits from Entity" game engine.

It's... playable. We certainly managed to get a lot of moving stuff on the screen,
with bouncy spring physics etc.
